    <!--
        The tag 'picture' has a semantic value in the HTML 5, where it is used to
        indicating that is a image to be loaded there. Inside the 'picture' tag it is
        necessary to have the tag 'img', because it is the tag that will in fact the image
        will be loaded.
        There is another tag that can be used along with img inside the 'picture' tag, that is
        the tag 'source'. This tag indicates source options for the image load. The atribute
        'srcset' defines the url/path of the image to be loaded.
            * If it is a format not accepted by the browser, it will try the other source
            options until find one that works. If no one works, the source indicated in
            the own 'img' tag by the atribute 'src' will be used.
            * For each soruce, it is possible also define a media query, specifying the
            dimensions of the browser width where the soruce must be loaded, using the 
            atribute 'media'.
            * The atribute 'type' defines the type of the image being loaded, like 'image/png'.

    <p>

    </p>
    <!--
        The tag 'audio' is used to load audio content in the HTML body. When used it will
        shows a audio control panel in the browser to control audio execution/pause, etc.
        The audio also can be played as background sound, not allowing user interact with it.
        It can has some atributes like:
            - 'controls' - Enable the control panel in the browser for the audio.
            - 'preload' - Indicates how/when the audio need to be loaded, with values:
                * 'none' - Audio will be loaded only when played by user
                * 'metadata' - Load only the basic data about audio, like name, duration.
                * 'auto' - Load the entire audio together with the browser page loading.
        As in the tag 'picture', in the 'audio' tag, it is possible to define sources for
        the audio loading, where the browser will try one by one, until find the one that
        works properly.
            * In the source it is possible to define the atributes 'src' and 'type', and 
            they work exactly as in the soruce of picture.
            * If any one of the sources work properly, the other content added inside
            the 'audio' tag, will be displayed.
