            In CSS Styles, there is a property named 'position', used to define
            the position of the element in the html body. This position will
            set the way this element will be showed and how it will interact
            with the other elements in the page. The possible values are:
                - 'static' - The default value of the position.

                - 'relative' - This value sets that the element will be placed
                    using the origin pivot axis as reference.

                - 'fixed' - This value sets that the element is also relative
                    to its pivot, but it will be fixed in the screen and not will
                    be affected by scrolling and will not interact with other elements

                - 'sticky' - Works almost as fixed. In this case, when its element is
                    being showed in the middle of the screen, away from the borders it
                    will work as a relative element, but when the page is scrolled and
                    this element is in edge of the border, it will be fixed in the
                    screen and will no be affected by the scrolling and also will not
                    interact with the other elements.

                - 'absolute' - This value define the element as absolute in the
                    screen, so it will be placed using the viewport as base. But if its
                    parent is an element with position 'relative', it will use this parent
                    as base to be placed.

                * all the 'relative-like' positions (relative, fixed, sticky, absolute)
                    can use the referencial axis properties to be placed:
                    'top', 'bottom', 'right' and 'left'.
