    <!--
        In CSS style files it is possible to declare what is called by 
        'pseudo-class', it is a class that can be defined for every selector
        in CSS, and indicates a behavior or event that can be related to the
        element attached to the selector. To add the pseudo-class, just use
        ':' after the selector. Examples:
            - 'hover' - The class that will be activated when the mouse
            get over the element.
            - 'visited' - The class that will be activated when a link
            is activated (after clicked).
            ...
