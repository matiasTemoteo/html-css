        /*
           There are other configurations in grid-layout used to handle
           the behaviour of adicional items in gric container. They are
           'grid-auto-rows' and 'grid-auto-columns'.

           The rows and columns defined in the CSS declaration by
           'grid-template' properties, are called explicit grid and
           define the total count of the visual configured grid-items.
           Example.: One grid with 3 rows and 3 columns have in total
           9 grid-items that we call explicit items, but there is possible
           have more than 9 items inside the container, so them will be called
           inplicit items and will not be formatted following configurations.
           But with the properties 'grid-auto-rows' and 'grid-auto-columns'
           it is possible define how these new items will be handled.

            - 'grid-auto-rows' - Define the size that will be used for
               new rows added beyond the explicit grid-rows.

               - Example:

                 - grid-auto-rows: 100px;
                 - grid-auto-rows: 50px;

             - 'grid-auto-columns' - Define the size that will be used for
                new columns added beyond the explicit grid-columns.

                - Example:

                  - grid-auto-columns: 150px;
                  - grid-auto-columns: 100px;

            There is another configuration used to define the flow of how
            the grid-items will be displayed inside the container, that is
            'grid-flow'. The possible values are:

              - 'row' - The grid-items will be displayed in row, following
                the grid-rows defines until the max items allowd by row (column count).
                When complete the row, it will continue displayig items by the next
                rows until have displayed all of them.

              - 'column' - The grid-items will be displayed in column, following
              the grid-columns defined until the max items allowd by column (row count).
              When complete the column, it will contonue displaying items by the next
              columns until have displayed all of them.


            There is a usefull function to repeat values, that can be unsed in
            properties like 'grid-temeplate' to simplify declarations. That is
            'repeat()'. the syntax is 'repeat(x, value)' where 'x' is the count
            of times the value will be added and 'value' is the value to be added
            in the property.

              - Examples:

                - grid-template-rows: repeat(3, auto);
                - grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 50px);


            It is possible mix types of declarations for values, such as using
            percentage, px or other typeof configurations.

              - Examples:

                - grid-template-rows: 100px repeat(2, 75px);


            There is another size unity beyond 'px' or '%'' possible to be used
            in grid-layout, this is 'fraction', declared as 'fr'. The fraction
            will works defining a part of the container size (height or width
            depending if is rows or columns being defined) for each grid-items
            declared, where the fraction values of these items will be relative
            between them. If a row declaration is 1fr 2fr 1fr, the first row
            will get 1 fraction of the total, the second one will get 2 fractions
            and will be two itmes bigger then the one and the third will get
            1 fraction and will be as the first one.

              - Examples:

                - grid-template-rows: 1fr 2fr 1fr;
                - grid-template-columns: 2fr 4fr 4fr;
                - grid-template: 2fr 1fr / 3fr 3fr 3fr;

            There is possible mix the declaration of rows and columns with
            percentage, pixels or fractions. But when working with different
            types including fractions, the fixed types will be considered first
            and them the fractions will use as base only the rest of size left
            after the other declarations (%, px, etc) being defined.
            
            So if there is the following declaration: 100px 25% 1fr 2fr for
            rows in a container of 1000px of width, we'll have 4 rows declared.

            The first one in px and second one in % will be considered first,
            totalizing: 100px + (30% of 1000px = 300px) = 400px. After that,
            the fractions will be considered, where the fraction values will
            divided using only 600px because it is what left after the fixed
            onws be considered.
            
            In this case, there are two items in fractions,  the first one as 1fr
            and second one in 2fr, totalizing 3frs defined, each one will have
            200px (600px / 3 = 200px).

            The defintion of size will be:

               1st fraction grid-item - 1fr = 200px;
               2nd fraction grid-item - 2fr = 400px;

             - Examples:

               - grid-template-rows: 5fr 2fr 1fr;
               - grid-template-columns: 25px 1fr 1fr 1fr;
               - grid-template: 2fr 1fr 2fr / 100px 10% 1fr 1fr;
