    <title>Grid Layout na Pr√°tica</title>
    <style>
        /*
            In CSS, there is a configuration called 'grid-layout', that can
            be used to create layouts of grid, organized by columns and rows
            and with responsive and flexible properties.

            To define a container as grid, just add 'display: grid'.

            Within the grid definition, there are some properties to create
            the columns and rows and define the structure of the grid. Those
            are: 

             - 'grid-template-columns' - Define the count of columns of the
                grid, where the column is generated in the horizontal flow, but
                the lines those define the columns are verticals.
                The count of columns is defined by the count of values added and
                the individual values defines the respective columns sizes.

                Example: 'grid-template-columns: 10px 20px 10px;'
                  - In this case, there was defined 3 columns, with the respective
                    sizes: 10px, 20px and 10px.

             - 'grid-template-rows' - Define the count of the rows of the grid,
                where the row is generated in the vertical flow, but the lines
                those define the rows are horizontals. 
                The count of rows is defined by the count of values added and
                the individual values defines the respective rows sizes.

                Example: 'grid-template-rows: 25px 20px 20px;'
                  - In this case, there are defined 3 rows, with the respective
                    sizes: 25px, 20px and 20px.

             - 'gap' - Define the gap existente between the grid-items in the
                grid container.

             Beyond the configurations to define the grid-layout structure, there
             are other configurations we can add in the container to configure the
             alignment of the content in the grid. They are:

              - 'align-items' - This property defines the alignment of the grid-items
                based on each grid-item area in a individually way. This property
                will set the alignment in the vertical. These are the possible values:

                - 'stretch' - It will stretch the grid-item in the respective area
                   in the whole size in vertical.

                - 'start' - It will align the grid-item in the start point of the
                   respective area (top).

                - 'center' - It will align the grid-item in the center of the
                   respective area.

                - 'end' - It will align the grid-item in the end point of the
                   respective area (bottom).

                - 'normal' (default) - Key-value, automatically uses 'stretch' as
                   config.

              - 'justify-items' - This property defines the alignment of the grid-items
                 based on each grid-item area in a individually way. This property
                 will set the alignment in the horizontal. These are the possible values:

                 - 'stretch' - It will stretch the grid-item in the respective area
                    in the whole size in horizontal.

                 - 'start' - It will align the grid-item in the start point of the
                    respective area (left).

                 - 'center' - It will align the grid-item in the center of the
                    respecive area.

                 - 'end' - It will align the grid-item in the end point of the
                    respective area (right).

                 - 'normal' (default) - Key value, automatically uses 'stretch' as
                    config.

              - 'align-content' - This property defines the alignment of the
                 content inside the container based on the container area, not
                 focusing in individual grid-items, but in the all content
                 at same time. This property will set the alignment in the
                 vertical. These are the possible properties:

                 - 'start' - Aligns the content in the start point of the container
                    in the vertical (top).

                 - 'center' - Aligns the content in the center of the container
                    based on the vertical.

                 - 'end' - Aligns the content in the end point of the container
                    in the horizontal (bottom).

                 - 'space-between' - Aligns the first grid-row (and its grid-items)
                    in the start point of the container (top), aligns the last
                    grid-row (and its grid-items) in the end point of the container
                    (bottom) and for the other middle grid-rows (and its grid-items),
                    define a simetric space between them.

                 - 'space-evenly' - Aligns all the grid-rows by defining simetric
                    spaces between them (even between the first/last grid-rows 
                    and edges and respective edges) in the vertical.

                 - 'space-around' - Aligns all the grid-rows, defining a simetric
                    space around all of them, when the first/last ones will
                    have only the own space between them and the edges, while the
                    middle grid-rows will have the own spaces summed to the spaces
                    of the grid-rows above and bellow them, all of that following
                    the vertical way.

                 - 'stretch' - It will stretchs all the grid-rows in the vertical
                    maintaining a simetric size for all, aimming to use all space
                    available.

                 - 'normal' (default) - Key value, automatically used 'stretch' config.

              - 'justify-content' - This property defines the alignment of the
                 content inside the container based on the container area, not
                 focusing in individual grid-items, but in the all content at
                 same time. This property will set the alignment in the horizontal.
                 These are the possible values:

                 - 'start' - Aligns the content in the start point of the container
                    in the horizontal (left).

                 - 'center' - Aligns the content in the center of the container,
                    based on the horizontal.

                 - 'end' - Aligns the content in the end point of the container in 
                    the horizontal (right).

                 - 'space-between' - Aligns the first grid-column (and its grid-items)
                    in the start point of the container (left). aligns the last
                    grid-column (and its grid-items) in the end point of the container
                    (right) an for the other middle grid-rows (and its grid-items),
                    defines a simetric space between them.

                 - 'space-evenly' - Aligns all the grid-columns by defining simetric
                    spaces between them (even between the first/last grid-columns
                    and the respective edges) in the horizontal.

                 - 'space-around' - Aligns all the grid-columns, defining a simetric
                    space around all of them, when the first/last ones will have
                    only their own space between them and the respective edges,
                    while, the middle ones will have their own spaces summed to the
                    spaces of the grid-columns at each side of them. All of that,
                    following the horizontal way.

                 - 'stretch' - It will stretchs all the grid-columns in the horizontal
                    maintaining a simetric size for all, aimming ot use all space
