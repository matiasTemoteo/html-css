        The tag 'video' can be used to define a video content in the HTML body.
        The video content will be displayed as a video player, when the controls
        visibility is optional.
        There are some atributes that can be defined, like:
            - 'width' - The width of the video window
            - 'height' - The height of the video window
            - 'poster' - The placeholder image, to show before video is played (thumbnail)
            - 'controls' - Enable the controls for the video player
        As in the tag 'picture' and in the tag 'audio', it is possible to define sources for
        the video loading, where the browser will try one by one, until find the one that
        works properly.
            * In the source it is possible to define the atributes 'src' and 'type', and 
            they work exactly as in the soruce of audio.
            * If any one of the sources work properly, the other content added inside
            the 'audio' tag, will be displayed.
