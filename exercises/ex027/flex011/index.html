        /*
            In flex-box, there is two properties, called: 'flex-grow' and 'flex-shrink',
            these properties are related to the items growing and shrinking inside the
            container. The possible values are:
             - '0' - (default for grow) - For both it will define the resizing will
               not be applied and the items will not follow the container resizing.
             - '1' - (default for shrink) - For both it will define the resizing
               will be applied, and the items will follow the container resizing.
             - '> 1' - This value will define that the item will have its resizing
               tax applied x times more than the minor no 0 value applied for another
               item in the container. Examples:
                - item 'a' with grow '1' and item b with grow '2':
                  - The item 'b' will grow in a tax 2 time bigger than item 'a'
                - item 'a' with grow '2' and item b with grow '4':
                  - The item 'b' will grow in a tax 2 time bigger than item 'a'

                - item 'a' with shrink '1' and item b with shrink '2':
                  - The item 'b' will shrink in a tax 2 time bigger than item 'a'
                - item 'a' with shrink '2' and item b with shrink '4':
                  - The item 'b' will shrink in a tax 2 time bigger than item 'a'
