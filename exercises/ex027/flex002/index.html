        /*
            There is a configuration in flex-box that define the
            direction of the content inside the container. That is
            'flex-direction'. It has 4 different direction possible:
              - 'row' - The elements will be placed in horizontal (left -> right)
              - 'row-reverse' - Also horizontal but inverse (right -> left)
              - 'column' - The elements will be placed in vertical (top -> bottom)
              - 'column-reverse' - Also vertical but inverse (bottom -> top)

            * Each direction has two axis created in the container and used
            to position and alignement of the elements. Each one
            has two points that define the position axis: 'start' and 'end'.
            These are:
              - 'main-axis' - Start point is the origin of the elements and
                end point is where ends the flow of the elements.
              - 'cross-axis' - When it is direction row, the start point is in
                the top of the container and the end point is in the bottom.
                When it is direction column, the start point is in the left
                side of the container and the end point is in the right.
